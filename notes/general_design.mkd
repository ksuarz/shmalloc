shmfree
======
Right now, using a basic locking system where only the mutex on the first header
is initialized and use. So we lock the entire chunk for every operation. This
can be fixed later so we only lock what we absolutely need to. Yay concurrency!

initialize_header
================
This was changed from the original create_header because we don't want to create
and return a pointer, otherwise we would need the shmptr. This just initializes
all of the values.
